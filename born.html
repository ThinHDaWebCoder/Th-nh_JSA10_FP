                <h1>The origins.</h1>
            <p>The earliest reported Women's Day observance, called "Woman's Day", was held on February 28, 1909, in New York City, organized by the Socialist Party of America at the suggestion of activist Theresa Malkiel. There have been claims that the day was commemorating a protest by women garment workers in New York on March 8, 1857, but researchers have declared this to be a myth intended to detach International Women's Day from its socialist origin.
                In August 1910, an International Socialist Women's Conference was organized in Copenhagen, Denmark, ahead of the general meeting of the Socialist Second International. Inspired by American socialists, German delegates at the International Socialist Women's Conference proposed the establishment of an annual "Women's Day", although no date was specified. This was meant to promote women's suffrage, and was based on the model of the annual May Day celebrations.
                The following year, on March 18, 1911, the first International Women's Day was marked by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland. For example, women paraded around the Ringstrasse in Vienna, carrying red flags honoring the martyrs of the Paris Commune, and demonstrated in support of the right of women to vote. In Austria-Hungary alone, there were 300 demonstrations. The Socialist delegates to the Austrian parliament publicly supported the right of women to vote for the first time. Across Europe, women demanded the right to vote and to hold public office, and protested against employment sex discrimination.
                According to the International Labour Organization, the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in New York City on March 25, 1911, “established the modern celebration of International Women’s Day in history.” The fire killed 146 workers, most of whom were women and girls – the dead were 123 women and girls and 23 men.
                IWD initially had no set date, though it was generally celebrated in late February or early March. Americans continued to observe "National Women's Day" on the last Sunday in February, while Russia observed International Women's Day for the first time in 1913, on the last Saturday in February (albeit based on the Julian calendar, as in the Gregorian calendar, the date was March 8). In 1914, International Women's Day was held on March 8 for the first time in Germany, possibly because that date was a Sunday. As elsewhere, Germany's observance was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918. Also on March 8, 1914, there was a march in London from Bow to Trafalgar Square in support of women's suffrage, during which Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested in front of Charing Cross station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.
